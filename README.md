# fried rice
Scope of this mod:
- Prepatching for my mods
- Compatibility patches
- (re)Balance patches
- Remove bloat from external mods

This mod should **never** add content to the game. New defs should **always** be added in a separate mod. For example, adding an existing recipe to an existing workbench **is within** the scope of this mod. However, creating a new recipe to add to an existing workbench **is not within** the scope of this mod.

## Supported Mods
Mod patches are balanced around the default value for toggable patches because I'm not writing a million lines of patch logic for every toggle. For example, [gene expansion](https://github.com/boomersama/boomer.genes) removes genetic aptitudes by default and the VRE Phytokins patch compensates for that metabolism loss. If aptitudes are toggled back on, Phytokin will have +1 metabolism.
